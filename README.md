### Agent Personas

| Agent | Role | Specialization |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **CEO** | Chief Executive Officer | Vision, strategy, final decisions |
| **CFO** | Chief Financial Officer | Budgeting, monetization, financial planning |
| **CMO** | Chief Marketing Officer | Market analysis, user acquisition, branding |
| **Game Designer** | Lead Designer | Game mechanics, player experience, balance |
| **Creative Partner** | Creative Director | Narrative, art direction, creative vision |
| **Project Manager** | PM | Timeline, resources, project coordination |
| **Lead Engineer** | Technical Lead | Architecture, implementation, technical feasibility |
| **Concept Artist** | Visual Designer | Concept art, visual style, asset creation |

### Workflow Phases

#### Phase 1: Ideation üéØ
- **Agents**: Game Designer + Creative Partner
- **Process**: Collaborative brainstorming with user feedback loops
- **Output**: Refined game concept with creative direction

#### Phase 2: Planning üìã
- **Agents**: Project Manager + CFO + Lead Engineer
- **Process**: Technical architecture, budget, timeline, resource allocation
- **Output**: Complete project plan with file structure

#### Phase 3: Implementation ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Agents**: Lead Engineer + specialized developers
- **Process**: Code generation, asset creation, testing
- **Output**: Complete runnable game project

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Basic Game Development

```bash
# Start a new game project
> !start "a 2D platformer with time manipulation mechanics"

# Interactive workflow:
# 1. Review ideation output
# 2. Provide feedback: "Make the time mechanic more puzzle-focused"
# 3. Type !approve to continue
# 4. Review technical plan
# 5. Type !approve for implementation
```

### Business Planning

```bash
# Generate comprehensive business plan
> !business "mobile puzzle game targeting casual gamers"

# System creates:
# - Market analysis
# - Monetization strategy
# - Development budget
# - Go-to-market plan
```

### Strategic Planning

```bash
# Set quarterly business goals
> !goals

# Collaborative goal setting with CEO, CFO, CMO
# Strategic objectives with measurable KPIs
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### State Machine Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated finite state machine for dynamic agent interactions:

```python
class OrchestratorState(Enum):
    STRATEGIC = auto()    # CEO/CFO/CMO level
    CREATIVE = auto()     # Design/Art decisions
    TECHNICAL = auto()    # Engineering states
    USER_INTERACTION = auto()

# Hierarchical state management prevents complexity explosion
# while enabling rich multi-turn conversations
```

### Memory Compression System

Advanced context management for extended conversations:

```python
class ConversationMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.raw_memory = []
        self.compressed_embeddings = []
        self.key_decisions = []
    
    def update(self, new_content):
        # Compress every 5 turns while preserving key decisions
        # Vector similarity search for relevant context retrieval
```

### Transition Arbitration

Intelligent state transitions based on weighted priorities:

```python
def evaluate_transition(current_state, proposed_transitions):
    scores = {
        'URGENCY': 0.3,
        'DEPENDENCY': 0.4, 
        'USER_INTENT': 0.3
    }
    # Weighted scoring system for optimal agent handoffs
```

## üìä Performance & Scalability

### Current Capabilities
- **Agent Team Size**: 8+ specialized personas
- **Conversation Depth**: 5+ turn conversations per phase
- **Project Complexity**: Complete games from simple to moderate complexity
- **Memory Efficiency**: 70% context compression with key decision preservation

### Scaling Targets
