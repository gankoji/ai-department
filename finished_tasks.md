### 1. DONE: V7-Orchestrator Evaluation

**Project Summary:**
I have created the **V7-Orchestrator**, a terminal-based application in Python that uses a multi-agent system to automate the game development lifecycle. It takes a project description from you, moves through Ideation, Planning, and Implementation phases, and generates a complete code repository for a new game project. The agents collaborate using a shared transcript, and you guide the process with feedback and approval commands.

**How to Evaluate:**
Here are the steps to test if the system meets your requirements:

1.  **Navigate to the directory:** `cd v7_orchestrator`
2.  **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  **Set up your API Key:** Create a `.env` file and add your Google API key like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key_here"`
4.  **Run the application:** `python main.py`
5.  **Start a test project:** At the `>` prompt, type `!start a simple clicker game where you tap a cookie`.
6.  **Test the Ideation phase:** The Game Designer and Creative Partner will provide initial ideas. Give them some feedback (e.g., `I think it should be a cat instead of a cookie`).
7.  **Test the approval flow:** Once you're happy with the refined idea, type `!approve` to move to the Planning phase.
8.  **Review the plan:** The Project Manager will propose a file structure. You can either approve it or give feedback to revise it.
9.  **Approve for implementation:** Type `!approve` again.
10. **Verify the output:** The system will generate all the files. Once it's done, check the new directory (e.g., `simple_clicker_game/`) to see if the code and structure are reasonable.
