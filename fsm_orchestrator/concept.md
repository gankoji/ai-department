### Non-Deterministic FSM-Based Orchestrator Architecture

**Vision:** Transform the V7-Orchestrator from a linear graph-based system to a sophisticated finite state machine where each agent persona represents a state, enabling dynamic multi-agent conversations with multiple feedback cycles per layer.

**Current Architecture Analysis:**
* **Existing System:** Linear DAG-based workflow (Ideation → Planning → Implementation) with single-pass agent interactions
* **Limitation:** Each agent gets one turn per phase, limited feedback loops, rigid progression
* **Opportunity:** Enable agents to dynamically handoff to each other, have multi-turn conversations, and provide richer collaborative experiences

**Critique of Initial Plan (Based on Modern Agent Frameworks):**
1. **State Explosion Risk:** The 1:1 agent-to-state mapping could lead to unmanageable complexity as the team grows. Modern systems like Codex CLI use hierarchical state machines to avoid this.
2. **Transition Ambiguity:** The plan lacks clear rules for handling competing transition requests from multiple agents - a problem Gemini CLI solves with weighted priority queues.
3. **Context Propagation:** Current design doesn't address how conversational context persists across state transitions, something Claude Code handles via compressed memory embeddings.

**Research Findings:**

*From 2024 Multi-Agent Research:*
* **Orchestration Patterns:** Centralized (hub-based), Dynamic (adaptive role assignment), Graph-based (DAG construction)
* **State Management:** Shared belief states, memory/reflection mechanisms, dynamic agent selection
* **Communication Structures:** Hierarchical, decentralized, and centralized coordination models
* **Key Architecture:** LLMO (LLM Orchestration) as finite-state Markov chain with proven convergence properties

*From Gemini CLI Architecture:*
* **Core Pattern:** Separation of CLI (frontend) and Core (backend) with central orchestrator
* **State Management:** Conversation/session state management in core package
* **Tool Integration:** Dynamic tool execution with user approval workflows
* **Modularity:** Event-driven, state-transition model with extensible tool system

**Enhanced Architecture Proposal:**

**1. Hierarchical FSM Design**
```python
class OrchestratorState(Enum):
    STRATEGIC = auto()  # CEO/CFO/CMO level
    CREATIVE = auto()   # Design/Art
    TECHNICAL = auto()  # Engineering
    USER_INTERACTION = auto()

# Each major state contains sub-states
class CreativeState(State):
    substates = {
        'CONCEPT': ConceptArtistState,
        'DESIGN': GameDesignerState,
        'ART_DIRECTION': ArtDirectorState
    }
```

**2. Transition Arbitration System**
```python
def evaluate_transition(current_state, proposed_transitions):
    scores = {
        'URGENCY': 0.3,
        'DEPENDENCY': 0.4, 
        'USER_INTENT': 0.3
    }
    return max(proposed_transitions, key=lambda x: sum(
        x.criteria[crit] * weight for crit, weight in scores.items()
    ))
```

**3. Context Management (Memory Compression)**
```python
class ConversationMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.raw_memory = []
        self.compressed_embeddings = []
    
    def update(self, new_content):
        self.raw_memory.append(new_content)
        if len(self.raw_memory) > 5:  # Compress every 5 turns
            self.compressed_embeddings.append(
                llm_embedding("Summarize key decisions:\n" + "\n".join(self.raw_memory[-5:]))
            )
            self.raw_memory = []
```

**Implementation Strategy:**

* **Phase 1: FSM Design & Architecture (POC Focus)**
  * **Hierarchical FSM State Mapping:**
    * Major states: STRATEGIC, CREATIVE, TECHNICAL, USER_INTERACTION
    * Each major state contains specialized sub-states (agents)
    * Prevents state explosion as team grows beyond 20+ agents
  * **Agent Transition Logic:**
    * Agents make explicit handoff decisions: `APPROVE_AND_HANDOFF`, `REQUEST_REWORK`, `HANDOFF_TO_AGENT`
    * Each agent can approve its inputs (proceed) or request rework from previous agent
    * Agent responses include transition recommendations: "I approve this concept. Handing off to CFO for financial analysis."
  * **State Transition Rules:**
    * Agent-driven transitions: Agents explicitly request next state in their response
    * User-driven transitions: Only from user-involved states (`!approve`, `!handoff CEO`, `!rework`)
    * System-driven transitions: Automatic progression to user states when required
  * **V2 Architecture:**
    * Create `V7OrchestratorV2` with FSM core alongside existing linear system
    * Add mode selection: `!simple` (current DAG) vs `!fsm` (new state machine)
    * Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows

* **Phase 1.5: Enhanced Infrastructure**
  * **State Hierarchy Implementation:**
    * Build nested state containers
    * Implement priority-based transition arbiter
    * Add memory compression system
  * **Performance Optimizations:**
    * Add state transition caching
    * Implement lazy loading for less frequent states
    * Build state dependency graph for pre-warming

* **Phase 2: Agent Transition Logic**
  * Implement agent-initiated handoffs (e.g., "Let me bring in the CFO to discuss budget implications")
  * Enable context-aware state transitions based on conversation content
  * Add user commands for explicit state control (!call_agent, !switch_to, !continue)
  * Design conflict resolution for simultaneous agent activation requests

* **Phase 3: Enhanced Interaction Patterns**
  * Multi-turn agent conversations within single workflow phases
  * Agent-to-agent direct communication (bypassing user temporarily)
  * Dynamic workflow creation based on detected user needs
  * Parallel agent processing with synchronization points

* **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
  * Non-deterministic transitions allowing multiple valid next states
  * Agent confidence scoring to influence transition probabilities
  * Learning from conversation patterns to improve state selection
  * Integration with external data sources for context-aware transitions

**Technical Architecture:**

* **State Machine Core:**
  * `FSMOrchestrator` class managing global state and transitions
  * `AgentState` base class with entry/exit hooks and transition logic
  * `ConversationMemory` for cross-state context persistence
  * `TransitionEngine` for parsing agent responses and executing state changes
  * `StateVisualizer` for displaying current FSM state to user

* **Agent Integration:**
  * Refactor existing Agent class to inherit from `AgentState`
  * **Agent Response Format:** Structured responses with transition directives:
    ```
    {
      "content": "agent response text",
      "transition": "APPROVE_AND_HANDOFF",
      "next_agent": "CFO",
      "approval_status": "APPROVED" | "REQUEST_REWORK",
      "rework_reason": "optional explanation for rework request"
    }
    ```
  * **Agent Capabilities:**
    * `can_approve_input()`: Agent evaluates and approves/rejects previous agent's work
    * `determine_next_agent()`: Agent decides optimal next state based on conversation context
    * `request_rework()`: Agent can send work back to previous agent with specific feedback

* **State Transition Mechanics:**
  * **Agent-Driven:** Parse transition directives from agent responses
  * **Approval Chain:** Track approval status through agent chain, enable rework loops
  * **User-Involved States:** Automatic transition to `RespondToUser_State` when user input needed
  * **State History:** Maintain stack for rework operations (agent can return to previous state)

* **User Interface:**
  * Enhanced command system supporting FSM navigation
  * Real-time state visualization in terminal
  * Agent conversation threads with branching support
  * Approval workflows for state transitions vs. agent responses

**Complexity Assessment:**
* **High Complexity Task:** Requires fundamental architectural changes to current system
* **Estimated Scope:** 2-3 week implementation for core FSM, additional 1-2 weeks for advanced features
* **Prerequisites:** Deep understanding of current agent interaction patterns and user workflows
* **Risk Factors:** Potential increase in conversation complexity, need for sophisticated state management

**Success Metrics:**
* Agents can have 3+ turn conversations within single workflow phase
* User can interrupt and redirect agent conversations dynamically
* System supports 5+ simultaneous agent collaboration patterns
* Conversation quality improves through richer agent interactions
* Development workflow efficiency increases by 25%+ due to better agent coordination

**Questions for Implementation:**
1. Should state transitions be primarily agent-driven, user-driven, or context-driven?
2. How should we handle state loops and prevent infinite agent conversations?
3. What level of user control vs. autonomous agent behavior is optimal?
4. Should we maintain backward compatibility with current linear workflows?
5. How do we prevent the FSM from becoming overwhelming for users to navigate?

**Phase 1 POC Deliverables:**
* **Core FSM Implementation:**
  * `FSMOrchestrator` class with basic state management
  * 3-4 agent states (CEO, CFO, Game Designer, Creative Partner) + user/approval states
  * State transition engine that parses agent response directives
  * Simple state visualization in terminal (e.g., "Current State: [CEO_State] → Pending: CFO_State")

* **Agent Approval/Rework System:**
  * Modified agent prompts to include transition directives in responses
  * Rework loop capability (agent can reject previous agent's work and request changes)
  * Approval chain tracking through conversation flow

* **Dual Mode Support:**
  * Command to switch between `!simple` (current DAG) and `!fsm` (new state machine)
  * Maintain existing workflows for backward compatibility
  * New FSM workflow that demonstrates agent-to-agent handoffs with approval cycles

**Next Steps for Phase 1:**
* Create `v7_orchestrator_v2.py` with basic FSM infrastructure
* Implement `AgentState` base class and refactor 2-3 existing agents
* Build transition parsing system for agent responses
* Test basic handoff pattern: Creative Partner → Game Designer → Creative Partner (rework) → Game Designer (approve) → CEO
* Add state visualization and FSM command system to main CLI

**2. Transition Arbitration Scenarios**

**Scenario A: Competing Transitions**
```
Current State: GameDesigner_State
Proposed Transitions:
- LeadEngineer: "Need technical feasibility review" (URGENCY: 0.8, DEPENDENCY: 0.9, USER_INTENT: 0.3)
- ArtDirector: "Visual style needs definition" (URGENCY: 0.4, DEPENDENCY: 0.6, USER_INTENT: 0.7)
- CEO: "Business viability question" (URGENCY: 0.9, DEPENDENCY: 0.5, USER_INTENT: 0.8)

Arbitration:
LeadEngineer Score: (0.8 * 0.3) + (0.9 * 0.4) + (0.3 * 0.3) = 0.75
ArtDirector Score: (0.4 * 0.3) + (0.6 * 0.4) + (0.7 * 0.3) = 0.57
CEO Score: (0.9 * 0.3) + (0.5 * 0.4) + (0.8 * 0.3) = 0.71

Winner: LeadEngineer (highest dependency score indicates blocking issue)
```

**Scenario B: Context-Aware Transitions**
```
Previous Context: "Budget concerns raised, need cost analysis"
Current Agent: GameDesigner
Proposed Action: "Add multiplayer feature"

System Detection: Budget context + expensive feature = auto-route to CFO
Override Normal Transition: GameDesigner → CFO (budget review) → GameDesigner
```

**Scenario C: User Intent Override**
```
System Recommendation: Creative → Technical
User Command: "!handoff CEO"
Result: Direct transition to CEO_State regardless of system recommendation
Context Preservation: Pass full conversation history to CEO with "User-requested transition" flag
```
