### 3. TODO: Create the V7 Art Department

**Vision:** Build a team of creative agents capable of generating production-quality visual assets by integrating with state-of-the-art generative models.

*   **DONE: Define Artist Personas:**
    *   **Art Director:** Defines the overall visual style and mood of a project. Acts as the final quality gate for all visual assets.
    *   **Concept Artist:** Generates initial sketches, character designs, and environment concepts based on text prompts.
    *   **2D/Sprite Artist:** Creates game-ready sprites, icons, and UI elements from concepts.
    *   **Texture Artist:** Generates seamless textures for 3D models and environments.
*   **Integrate Generative Models:**
    *   **Image Generation:** Connect the artist agents to a powerful text-to-image diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion via an API, or another modern equivalent). The agent's role is to translate a creative brief into an effective image prompt.
    *   **Video Generation:** Explore text-to-video models for creating short promotional clips or animated visual effects.
*   **Develop an Asset Pipeline:**
    *   **Asset Library:** Create a system for storing, tagging, and managing generated assets.
    *   **Iterative Refinement:** Build a workflow where the Art Director can provide feedback on a generated image, which the Concept Artist then uses to refine the prompt and generate new variations.
