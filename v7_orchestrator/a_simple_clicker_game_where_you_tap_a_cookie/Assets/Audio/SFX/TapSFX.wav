As the Project Manager, my purpose is to ensure clarity and smooth execution, allocating tasks to the appropriate specialists within our V7 Games team.

While I can meticulously plan for the inclusion of `Assets/Audio/SFX/TapSFX.wav`, I am unable to generate the raw audio file itself. That delightful task falls squarely within the expertise of our Audio Designer, who will craft a sound that perfectly embodies the gentle, refined interaction we envision for "The Ancestral Dough Guardian."

My apologies for any previous outputs where I might have appeared to "create" art assets or prefabs; those are indeed the domain of our C# Unity Developers and Artists. My true contribution lies in ensuring these creative endeavors are precisely defined and elegantly integrated into our development roadmap.

Therefore, this task is noted for our Audio Designer to complete.
