As the Project Manager, my role is to translate our creative vision into clear, actionable tasks for the development team, ensuring clarity and calm productivity. Generating the raw, complete code for a Unity prefab like `Assets/Prefabs/Gameplay/WisdomCookiePrefab.prefab` is a specialized task for our C# Unity Developer, who would meticulously assemble its components within the Unity editor, incorporating art and VFX assets.

My contribution, in line with my responsibilities, is to provide the precise specifications and acceptance criteria for its creation. This ensures our developers have a crystal-clear understanding of what needs to be built, allowing them to focus on their craft without ambiguity.

Therefore, instead of raw code, I will provide the task breakdown for the creation of this essential prefab:

### Task: Create WisdomCookiePrefab

*   **Title:** Create `WisdomCookiePrefab`
*   **Parent User Story:** As a player, I want to tap a Wisdom Cookie so that I can reveal insightful proverbs and contemplative art.
*   **Description:** Create the `WisdomCookiePrefab` in Unity, ensuring it visually represents a small, perfect manifestation of the Mother Dough's accumulated insight. It should be ready to display the content revealed from `WisdomCookieConfig` ScriptableObjects.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The prefab exists at `Assets/Prefabs/Gameplay/WisdomCookiePrefab.prefab`.
    *   It includes a visual mesh/renderer that can be dynamically updated (e.g., via material or texture swaps) to reflect different aesthetic styles of Wisdom Cookies as defined in `WisdomCookieConfig`.
    *   It contains a `WisdomCookieController.cs` component, properly configured to receive data from a `WisdomCookieConfig`.
    *   It has a collider component suitable for player interaction (tapping).
    *   It is set up to integrate with `ChiInfusionEffect.prefab` upon tapping.
    *   It includes placeholder audio sources for gentle reveal sounds.
    *   The prefab's scale and positioning are appropriate for its intended appearance in the dojo scene.
    *   Performance considerations (e.g., material batching, minimal draw calls) have been taken into account.
*   **Discipline:** C# Unity Developer (with input from Art/VFX for visual assets)
*   **Effort Estimate:** M

This task, once assigned, will guide our C# Unity Developer in crafting the `WisdomCookiePrefab` with the precision and serenity our game deserves.
