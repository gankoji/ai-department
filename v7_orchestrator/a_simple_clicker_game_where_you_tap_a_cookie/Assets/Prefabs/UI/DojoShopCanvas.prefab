As the Project Manager for V7 Games, my role is to oversee the project's execution, manage tasks, and ensure clarity and efficiency for the team. Generating the raw code for a Unity Prefab (`.prefab` file) falls outside the scope of my responsibilities.

Creating and implementing the actual prefab asset, including its UI elements, layout, and connections to scripts, is a technical development task. This would typically be handled by a **C# Unity Developer** or a dedicated **UI/UX Designer** who works directly within the Unity engine.

My function would be to create a detailed task for the relevant developer to build this `DojoShopCanvas.prefab` based on the game design specifications.

Therefore, I cannot provide the raw code for the prefab file itself. Please reassign this task to the appropriate technical persona.
